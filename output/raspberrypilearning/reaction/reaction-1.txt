An image will be displayed on the micro:bit after a random amount of time - the first person to press their button is the winner.\n\nChildren will make use of all of the coding concepts used in previous projects, as well as using Boolean operators to wait until a button has been pressed.\n\n## Resources\nFor this project, the [MakeCode (PXT)](http://jumpto.cc/pxt-new) microbit editor should be used.\n\nYou can find a completed version of this project at [makecode.microbit.org/#pub:50800-81674-84873-32898\n](https://makecode.microbit.org/#pub:50800-81674-84873-32898\n), and the compiled .hex file can be downloaded by clicking the 'Download Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:\n\n+ microbit-Reaction.hex\n\nThere is also a version of the project with the \"Keep score\" challenge completed. This can be found at [makecode.microbit.org/#pub:23812-11544-45113-45147\n](https://makecode.microbit.org/#pub:23812-11544-45113-45147\n), and the compiled .hex file can be downloaded by clicking the 'Download Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:\n\n+ microbit-Reaction-Score.hex\n\n## Learning Objectives\n+ Boolean operators:\n+ AND;\n+ NOT.\n\nThis project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):\n\n+ [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)\n\n## Challenges\n+ \"Choose your own image\" - changing the image displayed on the micro:bit.\n+ \"Choose your own delay\" - changing the parameters to the `random` function.\n+ \"Keep score\" - use variables to keep track of player scores.\n\n",
