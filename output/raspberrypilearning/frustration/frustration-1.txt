The aim of the game is to guide a wand along a course without making contact. Making contact will add one to the player's score - the player with the lowest score wins.\n\n## Resources\n\nTo complete this project, children will need:\n\n+ Metal wire (approx. 50cm);\n+ Putty;\n+ Electrical tape (optional);\n+ Crocodile leads (optional).\n\nSteps 1 and 2 of this project can be completed without this equipment.\n\nFor this project, the [MakeCode (PXT)](http://jumpto.cc/pxt-new) microbit editor should be used.\n\nYou can find a completed version of this project at [makecode.microbit.org/#pub:71088-38400-20107-39742](https://makecode.microbit.org/#pub:71088-38400-20107-39742), and the compiled .hex file can be downloaded by clicking the 'Download Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:\n\n+ Frustration.hex\n\n## Learning Objectives\n+ Variables;\n+ Input/output (I/O) pins.\n\nThis project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):\n\n+ [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)\n\n+ [Use basic digital, analogue, and electromechanical components.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/creator)\n\n## Challenges\n+ \"Display an image\" - Display an image on the micro:bit before the number of `fails` is displayed.\n+ \"Cheat mode!\" - Subtract 1 from the `fails` variable when button B is pressed.\n+ \"Personalise your game\" - Make changes to the wand and course in order to make the game more difficult.\n\n\n",
